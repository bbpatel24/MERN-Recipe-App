# MERN-Recipe-App

Hello Everyone, 
I hope you guys are doing well, for long I have been wanting to build a full stack application which compelled me to learn the MERN Stack.
Personally, I was scared about learning the concepts of Mern Stack, so I grit my teeth and I finally pulled through.

Here are some of the features of this app:
-> This app uses JSON Web Tokens which are used for authentication and authorization purposes. JWTs are used to securely transmit user information between the frontend and backend.
-> This app allows users to create, store, retrieve, update, and delete recipes. The front-end built with React.js will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the app.
-> The backend built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB will handle the data storage and retrieval operations.

I am currently building an App which has similar usage as facebook and I will keep everyone posted on the updates well.

Bye!
